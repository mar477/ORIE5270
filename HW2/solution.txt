##### Problem 2

The libraries to install are:

| requests | pandas | io | gzip | numpy | matplotlib

The script is broken down into three parts as described by the comments.

###### Part 1: 
The first ten rows of df are given by: (when the script is called)

|       | Names           | NbrFriends |
| ------| --------------  | ---------- |               
|0      | Randy Lavergne  | 347 |
|1      | Jamie Jones     | 17  |
|2      | Jana Griggs     | 10  |
|3      | Charles Ericson | 17  |

###### Part 3:


The text (output2.txt) file contains the mean,median and variance of the number of friends

The pdf (output2.pdf) file contains the histogram of the number of friends

#### Question 3:

The libraries to install are:

| os | Keras | dumpy | Matplotlib |

Running the script (p3.py) will print out the summary of variables in the layers, and also output at each echo for each model. There are also three output graphs.
p3_output1.pdf --> Initial Convolution network
p3_output2.pdf --> Initial model + normalization layer after first convolutional layer
p3_output3.pdf --> Initial model + dropout-layer(rate=0.15) after first convolutional layer

We observe the following:
The val_loss (or test loss) is the same for models 1 and 3, and the loss (or train loss) is also the same for the two models. This means that the dropout layer did not do much change
On the other hand, there is a decrease in both the val_loss and loss values for model 2(with the normalization layer), where the value are always below the values for model 1 and 3(which are above 14.56 for the val_loss) at values around the 2 level.
So, a normalization layer is useful in reducing error.
